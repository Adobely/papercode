matrix.py creates coordinates and time matrix for every minute of each satellite by using starlink satellite TLE data.

StarCoverTime.py is the main program to use the ILP to find out the minimum number of attack points required within the limited attack time. It uses satellite_positions.csv(The coordinates of the satellites every minute captured by TLE on 2024-08-19), circle_centers.csv(potential attack points) and common_starlink_satellites.csv(make sure to use satellites with consistent TLE data for one week)
